# mini-city
#### A mini city using OpenGL and models using Blender
I add four additional buttons. Press “Q”, the camera will move down to the ground. Press “J” or “K”, the camera will move up and down respectively. The camera will not below to the ground. Press “E”, the light will switch, and texture will change to Sun or Moon according to the light.
In addition, I add an animation after pressing space bar. The camera will turn to the ground below slowly.
